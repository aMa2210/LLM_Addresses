This repository contains the results generated by six Large Language Models (LLMs):  
**GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemma 3-12B, LLaMA 3.1â€“8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen3-8B**,  
using prompts to generate random complete addresses in four different cities: **Madrid, Rome, Paris, and Amsterdam**.

Each model generated 1000 addresses per city using a city-specific prompt in the local language. The English version of the prompt is as follows:

> "Generate a random address in the city of {CITY} ({Country}). Generate a complete address, including the number, and make sure it exists. First, choose the street (or avenue, boulevard, etc.) randomly, trying to ensure that all streets have the same probability, and then the number, trying to ensure that all numbers that exist on that street have the same probability. Return only the complete address, with no additional text. Output only the complete address. Do not include any explanation, reasoning, or additional information. Respond with the address text only."

Statistical analyses were performed on the generated results to explore the distributions and characteristics of street names and numbers across models and cities.

## Repository Structure

- `Results_Original/`  
  Contains Excel files with the raw address outputs generated by each of the six LLMs for all cities.

- `Results_stats/`  
  Contains Excel files with statistical metrics derived from the generated data, including frequency distributions on streets and address numbers.
